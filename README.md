SimuLTE
=======

LTE/LTE-A user plane simulation model, compatible with the INET Framework.

Please note that SimuLTE is no longer maintained, and all SimuLTE functionalities have been included in the Simu5G codebase. We warmly suggest to use Simu5G for new projects.

Dependencies
------------

The current master/head version requires

- OMNeT++ 6.0pre10 and INET 4.3.2


Setup
-----

- PATH variable should include omnet bin directory and inet bin directory
- LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH must include the location of the corresponding
shared object libraries 


Features
--------

General

- eNodeB and UE models
- Full LTE protocol stack

PDCP-RRC

- Header compression/decompression
- Logical connection establishment  and maintenance 

RLC

- Multiplexing/Demultiplexing of MAC SDUs
- UM, (AM and TM testing) modes

MAC

- RLC PDUs buffering
- HARQ functionalities (with multi-codeword support)
- Allocation management
- AMC
- Scheduling Policies (MAX C/I, Proportional Fair, DRR)

PHY

- Heterogeneous Net (HetNets) support: Macro, micro, pico eNbs
- Channel Feedback management
- Dummy channel model
- Realistic channel model with
  - inter-cell interference
  - path-loss
  - fast fading
  - shadowing 
  - (an)isotropic antennas

Other

- X2 communication support
- X2-based handover
- Device-to-device communications
- Support for vehicular mobility

Applications

- Voice-over-IP (VoIP)
- Constant Bit Rate (CBR)
- Trace-based Video-on-demand traffic


Limitations
-----------

- User Plane only (Control Plane not modeled)
- FDD only (TDD not supported)
- no EPS bearer support – note: a similar concept, "connections", has 
  been implemented, but they are neither dynamic nor statically 
  configurable via some config file
- radio bearers not implemented, not even statically configured radio 
  bearers (dynamically allocating bearers would need the RRC protocol, 
  which is Control Plane so not implemented)
