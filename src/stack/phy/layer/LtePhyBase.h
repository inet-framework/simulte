/**
 * @class LtePhy
 * @brief Physical layer of Lte Nic.
 *
 * This class implements the physical layer of the Lte Nic.
 * It contains methods to manage analog models and decider.
 *
 * The module receives packets from the LteStack and
 * sends them to the air channel, encapsulated in LteAirFrames.
 *
 * The module receives LteAirFrames from the radioIn gate,
 * filters the received signal using the analog models,
 * processes the received signal using the decider,
 * then decapsulates the inner packet and sends it to the
 * LteStack with LteDeciderControlInfo attached.
